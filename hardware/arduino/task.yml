  <p>My friend made his own password token thing on an Arduino, connected to an EEPROM with 2 wires. For now, it is running on a simulator because he is poor.</p>
  <p>I recorded a trace of the 2 wires when he was entering his password. I also managed to extract the firmware when he wasn't noticing.</p>
  <p>Can you tell me his password?</p>
