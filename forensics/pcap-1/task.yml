  <p>Here is a packet capture of my computer when I was preparing my presentation on Google Slides. Can you reproduce the contents of the slides?</p>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you find a "fake flag", submit it here. You will find some text next to the flag saying it is not accepted, but now it is. There are 2 flags in the challenge, and both are accepted. Part 1 accepts the flag that is easier to get.</p>
