  <p>I know the "common modulus attack" on RSA. But as far as I know, the attacker can NOT factor n, right? I generated 63 keys with different public exponents. I also generated the check numbers to confirm the keys were valid. Sadly, public exponents and check numbers were leaked. Am I still safe?</p>
